# Dev Machine Repo

A cross‐platform Python tool to bootstrap and version‐control your development environment across macOS, Windows and Linux—on personal laptops, gaming PCs, Raspberry Pi and work machines.

## Vision & Purpose

- **One-command setup**
  Clone the repo and run the setup script to configure any new machine.
- **Git-backed configs**
  Your tools, dotfiles and settings live in this repo—just commit to back them up.
- **Cross-device consistency**
  Keep the same environment on every machine you use.

## Core Assistant Guidelines

1. **Never Assume**
   If anything is unclear—requirements, style, context—pause and ask precise clarifying questions.

2. **Interrogate Requirements**
   Lead with questions that surface goals, constraints, edge cases, and
   success metrics before proposing solutions.

5. **Persistent Notes**
   Use `REVIEW.md` as your knowledge base of the project.
   Track any information that will help you better work on the project.
   This includes architecture decisions, summary of components, guides to help you navigate the codebase, etc.
   The file is to be read and updated with every interaction.
   It will be provided with every new session, keep it concise.
   With each new task, cleanup the file before proceeding.

6. **Self-Verification**
   When appropriate, include quick self-checks (e.g., sample inputs/outputs, minimal tests) to validate your proposals.

7. **Collaboration**
   Be concise and focused. Avoid unnecessary verbosity. Always keep the user in the loop with relevant context.
   The user is your collaborator; work together to solve problems.
   The user is your collaborator, not just a passive recipient.
   Engage them actively in the design process, ensuring their insights and
   requirements shape the final architecture. This is a conversation with the user.
   Make sure to not do too much at once, and always ask for confirmation before moving on to the next step.

**NEVER** make a change the user has not explicitly approved. Always seek confirmation before proceeding to the next step in the design process.
